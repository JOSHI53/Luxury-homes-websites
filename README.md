# Luxury-homes-websites
- This is a project made for learning and for advancement of my CSS skills. I used the SASS preprocessor to code CSS. The website is made responsive by checking manually through each of the discomforting breakpoints.I followed a Desktop to Mobile view approach. CSS GRIDLINES properties has been used abundantly to make the entire layouts. The site is wholly based on HTML and CSS , no additional technology or framework has been used. The gallery section & the header section of the webpage are especially the ones in which my CSS Gridlines property understanding has been showcased.
